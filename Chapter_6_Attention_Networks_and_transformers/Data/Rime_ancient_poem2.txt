part i
it is an ancient mariner 
and he stoppeth one of three.
 by thy long grey beard and glittering eye 
now wherefore stopp st thou me 

the bridegroom s doors are opened wide 
and i am next of kin  
the guests are met  the feast is set   
may st hear the merry din. 

he holds him with his skinny hand 
 there was a ship   quoth he.
 hold off  unhand me  grey beard loon  
eftsoons his hand dropt he.

he holds him with his glittering eye 
the wedding guest stood still 
and listens like a three years  child   
the mariner hath his will.

the wedding guest sat on a stone   
he cannot choose but hear  
and thus spake on that ancient man 
the bright eyed mariner.

 the ship was cheered  the harbour cleared 
merrily did we drop
below the kirk  below the hill 
below the lighthouse top.

the sun came up upon the left 
out of the sea came he 
and he shone bright  and on the right
went down into the sea.

higher and higher every day 
till over the mast at noon  
the wedding guest here beat his breast 
for he heard the loud bassoon.

the bride hath paced into the hall 
red as a rose is she  
nodding their heads before her goes
the merry minstrelsy.

the wedding guest he beat his breast 
yet he cannot choose but hear  
and thus spake on that ancient man 
the bright eyed mariner.

and now the storm blast came  and he
was tyrannous and strong   
he struck with his o ertaking wings 
and chased us south along.

with sloping masts and dipping prow 
as who pursued with yell and blow
still treads the shadow of his foe 
and forward bends his head 
the ship drove fast  loud roared the blast 
and southward aye we fled.

and now there came both mist and snow 
and it grew wondrous cold   
and ice  mast high  came floating by 
as green as emerald.

and through the drifts the snowy clifts
did send a dismal sheen   
nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken 
the ice was all between.

the ice was here  the ice was there 
the ice was all around   
it cracked and growled  and roared and howled 
like noises in a swound 

at length did cross an albatross 
thorough the fog it came  
as if it had been a christian soul 
we hailed it in god s name.

it ate the food it ne er had eat 
and round and round it flew.
the ice did split with a thunder fit  
the helmsman steered us through 

and a good south wind sprung up behind  
the albatross did follow 
and every day  for food or play 
came to the mariner s hollo 

in mist or cloud  on mast or shroud 
it perched for vespers nine  
whiles all the night  through fog smoke white 
glimmered the white moon shine. 

 god save thee  ancient mariner 
from the fiends  that plague thee thus  
why look st thou so   with my cross bow
i shot the albatross.

part ii
the sun now rose upon the right   
out of the sea came he 
still hid in mist  and on the left
went down into the sea.

and the good south wind still blew behind 
but no sweet bird did follow 
nor any day for food or play
came to the mariner s hollo 

and i had done a hellish thing 
and it would work  em woe   
for all averred  i had killed the bird
that made the breeze to blow.
ah wretch  said they  the bird to slay 
that made the breeze to blow 

nor dim nor red  like god s own head 
the glorious sun uprist   
then all averred  i had killed the bird
that brought the fog and mist.
 twas right  said they  such birds to slay 
that bring the fog and mist.

the fair breeze blew  the white foam flew 
the furrow followed free  
we were the first that ever burst
into that silent sea.

down dropt the breeze  the sails dropt down 
 twas sad as sad could be  
and we did speak only to break
the silence of the sea 

all in a hot and copper sky 
the bloody sun  at noon 
right up above the mast did stand 
no bigger than the moon.

day after day  day after day 
we stuck  nor breath nor motion  
as idle as a painted ship
upon a painted ocean.

water  water  every where 
and all the boards did shrink  
water  water  every where 
nor any drop to drink.

the very deep did rot    o christ 
that ever this should be 
yea  slimy things did crawl with legs
upon the slimy sea.

about  about  in reel and rout
the death fires danced at night  
the water  like a witch s oils 
burnt green  and blue and white.

and some in dreams assurèd were
of the spirit that plagued us so  
nine fathom deep he had followed us
from the land of mist and snow.

and every tongue  through utter drought 
was withered at the root  
we could not speak  no more than if
we had been choked with soot.

ah  well a day  what evil looks
had i from old and young 
instead of the cross  the albatross
about my neck was hung.

part iii
there passed a weary time. each throat
was parched  and glazed each eye.
a weary time  a weary time 
how glazed each weary eye 

when looking westward  i beheld
a something in the sky.

at first it seemed a little speck 
and then it seemed a mist  
it moved and moved  and took at last
a certain shape  i wist.

a speck  a mist  a shape  i wist 
and still it neared and neared   
as if it dodged a water sprite 
it plunged and tacked and veered.

with throats unslaked  with black lips baked 
we could nor laugh nor wail  
through utter drought all dumb we stood 
i bit my arm  i sucked the blood 
and cried  a sail  a sail 

with throats unslaked  with black lips baked 
agape they heard me call   
gramercy  they for joy did grin 
and all at once their breath drew in.
as they were drinking all.

see  see      i cried  she tacks no more 
hither to work us weal  
without a breeze  without a tide 
she steadies with upright keel 

the western wave was all a flame.
the day was well nigh done 
almost upon the western wave
rested the broad bright sun  
when that strange shape drove suddenly
betwixt us and the sun.

and straight the sun was flecked with bars 
    heaven s mother send us grace  
as if through a dungeon grate he peered
with broad and burning face.

alas      thought i  and my heart beat loud 
how fast she nears and nears 
are those her sails that glance in the sun 
like restless gossameres 

are those her ribs through which the sun
did peer  as through a grate 
and is that woman all her crew 
is that a death  and are there two 
is death that woman s mate 

her lips were red  her looks were free 
her locks were yellow as gold   
her skin was as white as leprosy 
the night mare life in death was she 
who thicks man s blood with cold.

the naked hulk alongside came 
and the twain were casting dice  
 the game is done  i ve won  i ve won  
quoth she  and whistles thrice.

the sun s rim dips   the stars rush out  
at one stride comes the dark  
with far heard whisper  o er the sea 
off shot the spectre bark.

we listened and looked sideways up 
fear at my heart  as at a cup 
my life blood seemed to sip 
the stars were dim  and thick the night 
the steersman s face by his lamp gleamed white  
from the sails the dew did drip 
till clomb above the eastern bar
the hornèd moon  with one bright star
within the nether tip.

one after one  by the star dogged moon 
too quick for groan or sigh 
each turned his face with a ghastly pang 
and cursed me with his eye.

four times fifty living men 
    and i heard nor sigh nor groan 
with heavy thump  a lifeless lump 
they dropped down one by one.

the souls did from their bodies fly  
they fled to bliss or woe 
and every soul  it passed me by 
like the whizz of my cross bow 

part iv
 i fear thee  ancient mariner 
i fear thy skinny hand 
and thou art long  and lank  and brown 
as is the ribbed sea sand.

i fear thee and thy glittering eye 
and thy skinny hand  so brown.  
fear not  fear not  thou wedding guest 
this body dropt not down.

alone  alone  all  all alone 
alone on a wide wide sea 
and never a saint took pity on
my soul in agony.

the many men  so beautiful 
and they all dead did lie   
and a thousand thousand slimy things
lived on   and so did i.

i looked upon the rotting sea 
and drew my eyes away  
i looked upon the rotting deck 
and there the dead men lay.

i looked to heaven  and tried to pray  
but or ever a prayer had gusht 
a wicked whisper came  and made
my heart as dry as dust.

i closed my lids  and kept them close 
and the balls like pulses beat  
for the sky and the sea  and the sea and the sky
lay dead like a load on my weary eye 
and the dead were at my feet.

the cold sweat melted from their limbs 
nor rot nor reek did they   
the look with which they looked on me
had never passed away.

an orphan s curse would drag to hell
a spirit from on high  
but oh  more horrible than that
is the curse in a dead man s eye 
seven days  seven nights  i saw that curse 
and yet i could not die.

the moving moon went up the sky 
and no where did abide   
softly she was going up 
and a star or two beside 

her beams bemocked the sultry main 
like april hoar frost spread  
but where the ship s huge shadow lay 
the charmèd water burnt alway
a still and awful red.

beyond the shadow of the ship 
i watched the water snakes   
they moved in tracks of shining white 
and when they reared  the elfish light
fell off in hoary flakes.

within the shadow of the ship
i watched their rich attire   
blue  glossy green  and velvet black 
they coiled and swam   and every track
was a flash of golden fire.

o happy living things  no tongue
their beauty might declare   
a spring of love gushed from my heart 
and i blessed them unaware   
sure my kind saint took pity on me 
and i blessed them unaware.

the self same moment i could pray  
and from my neck so free
the albatross fell off  and sank
like lead into the sea.

part v
oh sleep  it is a gentle thing 
beloved from pole to pole 
to mary queen the praise be given 
she sent the gentle sleep from heaven 
that slid into my soul.

the silly buckets on the deck 
that had so long remained 
i dreamt that they were filled with dew  
and when i awoke  it rained.

my lips were wet  my throat was cold 
my garments all were dank  
sure i had drunken in my dreams 
and still my body drank.

i moved  and could not feel my limbs   
i was so light almost
i thought that i had died in sleep 
and was a blessed ghost.

and soon i heard a roaring wind   
it did not come anear  
but with its sound it shook the sails 
that were so thin and sere.

the upper air burst into life 
and a hundred fire flags sheen 
to and fro they were hurried about 
and to and fro  and in and out 
the wan stars danced between.

and the coming wind did roar more loud 
and the sails did sigh like sedge 
and the rain poured down from one black cloud  
the moon was at its edge.

the thick black cloud was cleft  and still
the moon was at its side   
like waters shot from some high crag 
the lightning fell with never a jag 
a river steep and wide.

the loud wind never reached the ship 
yet now the ship moved on 
beneath the lightning and the moon
the dead men gave a groan.

they groaned  they stirred  they all uprose 
nor spake  nor moved their eyes  
it had been strange  even in a dream 
to have seen those dead men rise.

the helmsman steered  the ship moved on  
yet never a breeze up blew  
the mariners all  gan work the ropes 
where they were wont to do  
they raised their limbs like lifeless tools 
we were a ghastly crew.

the body of my brother s son
stood by me  knee to knee   
the body and i pulled at one rope 
but he said nought to me.

 i fear thee  ancient mariner  
be calm  thou wedding guest 
 twas not those souls that fled in pain 
which to their corses came again 
but a troop of spirits blest   

for when it dawned they dropped their arms 
and clustered round the mast  
sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths 
and from their bodies passed.

around  around  flew each sweet sound 
then darted to the sun  
slowly the sounds came back again 
now mixed  now one by one.

sometimes a dropping from the sky
i heard the sky lark sing  
sometimes all little birds that are 
how they seemed to fill the sea and air
with their sweet jargoning 

and now  twas like all instruments 
now like a lonely flute  
and now it is an angel s song 
that makes the heavens be mute.

it ceased   yet still the sails made on
a pleasant noise till noon 
a noise like of a hidden brook
in the leafy month of june 
that to the sleeping woods all night
singeth a quiet tune.

till noon we quietly sailed on 
yet never a breeze did breathe   
slowly and smoothly went the ship 
moved onward from beneath.

under the keel nine fathom deep 
from the land of mist and snow 
the spirit slid    and it was he
that made the ship to go.
the sails at noon left off their tune 
and the ship stood still also.

the sun  right up above the mast 
had fixed her to the ocean   
but in a minute she  gan stir 
with a short uneasy motion 
backwards and forwards half her length
with a short uneasy motion.

then like a pawing horse let go 
she made a sudden bound   
it flung the blood into my head 
and i fell down in a swound.

how long in that same fit i lay 
i have not to declare  
but ere my living life returned 
i heard and in my soul discerned
two voices in the air.

 is it he   quoth one   is this the man 
by him who died on cross 
with his cruel bow he laid full low
the harmless albatross.

the spirit who bideth by himself
in the land of mist and snow 
he loved the bird that loved the man
who shot him with his bow. 

the other was a softer voice 
as soft as honey dew   
quoth he   the man hath penance done 
and penance more will do. 

part vi

first voice
 but tell me  tell me  speak again 
thy soft response renewing 
what makes that ship drive on so fast 
what is the ocean doing  

second voice
still as a slave before his lord 
the ocean hath no blast  
his great bright eye most silently
up to the moon is cast 

if he may know which way to go  
for she guides him smooth or grim.
see  brother  see  how graciously
she looketh down on him. 

first voice
 but why drives on that ship so fast 
without or wave or wind  

second voice
 the air is cut away before 
and closes from behind.

fly  brother  fly  more high  more high 
or we shall be belated   
for slow and slow that ship will go 
when the mariner s trance is abated. 

i woke  and we were sailing on
as in a gentle weather   
 twas night  calm night  the moon was high  
the dead men stood together.

all stood together on the deck 
for a charnel dungeon fitter   
all fixed on me their stony eyes 
that in the moon did glitter.

the pang  the curse  with which they died 
had never passed away   
i could not draw my eyes from theirs 
nor turn them up to pray.

and now this spell was snapt    once more
i viewed the ocean green 
and looked far forth  yet little saw
of what had else been seen 

like one  that on a lonesome road
doth walk in fear and dread 
and having once turned round walks on 
and turns no more his head  
because he knows  a frightful fiend
doth close behind him tread.

but soon there breathed a wind on me 
nor sound nor motion made   
its path was not upon the sea 
in ripple or in shade.

it raised my hair  it fanned my cheek
like a meadow gale of spring 
it mingled strangely with my fears 
yet it felt like a welcoming.

swiftly  swiftly flew the ship 
yet she sailed softly too   
sweetly  sweetly blew the breeze 
on me alone it blew.

oh  dream of joy  is this indeed
the light house top i see 
is this the hill  is this the kirk 
is this mine own countree 

we drifted o er the harbour bar 
and i with sobs did pray 
o let me be awake  my god 
or let me sleep alway.

the harbour bay was clear as glass 
so smoothly it was strewn 
and on the bay the moonlight lay 
and the shadow of the moon.

the rock shone bright  the kirk no less 
that stands above the rock   
the moonlight steeped in silentness
the steady weathercock.

and the bay was white with silent light 
till rising from the same 
full many shapes  that shadows were 
in crimson colours came.

a little distance from the prow
those crimson shadows were   
i turned my eyes upon the deck 
oh  christ  what saw i there 

each corse lay flat  lifeless and flat 
and  by the holy rood 
a man all light  a seraph man 
on every corse there stood.

this seraph band  each waved his hand   
it was a heavenly sight 
they stood as signals to the land 
each one a lovely light  

this seraph band  each waved his hand 
no voice did they impart 
no voice   but oh  the silence sank
like music on my heart.

but soon i heard the dash of oars 
i heard the pilot s cheer  
my head was turned perforce away
and i saw a boat appear.

the pilot and the pilot s boy 
i heard them coming fast   
dear lord in heaven  it was a joy
the dead men could not blast.

i saw a third i heard his voice   
it is the hermit good 
he singeth loud his godly hymns
that he makes in the wood.
he ll shrieve my soul  he ll wash away
the albatross s blood.

part vii
this hermit good lives in that wood
which slopes down to the sea.
how loudly his sweet voice he rears 
he loves to talk with marineres
that come from a far countree.

he kneels at morn  and noon  and eve 
he hath a cushion plump   
it is the moss that wholly hides
the rotted old oak stump.

the skiff boat neared    i heard them talk 
 why  this is strange  i trow 
where are those lights so many and fair 
that signal made but now  

 strange  by my faith   the hermit said 
 and they answered not our cheer 
the planks looked warped  and see those sails 
how thin they are and sere 
i never saw aught like to them 
unless perchance it were

brown skeletons of leaves that lag
my forest brook along  
when the ivy tod is heavy with snow 
and the owlet whoops to the wolf below 
that eats the she wolf s young. 

 dear lord  it hath a fiendish look 
    the pilot made reply 
i am a feared   push on  push on  
said the hermit cheerily.

the boat came closer to the ship 
but i nor spake nor stirred  
the boat came close beneath the ship 
and straight a sound was heard.

under the water it rumbled on 
still louder and more dread   
it reached the ship  it split the bay  
the ship went down like lead.

stunned by that loud and dreadful sound 
which sky and ocean smote 
like one that hath been seven days drowned
my body lay afloat  
but swift as dreams  myself i found
within the pilot s boat.

upon the whirl  where sank the ship 
the boat spun round and round  
and all was still  save that the hill
was telling of the sound.

i moved my lips the pilot shrieked
and fell down in a fit  
the holy hermit raised his eyes 
and prayed where he did sit.

i took the oars    the pilot s boy 
who now doth crazy go 
laughed loud and long  and all the while
his eyes went to and fro.
 ha  ha   quoth he   full plain i see 
the devil knows how to row. 

and now  all in my own countree 
i stood on the firm land 
the hermit stepped forth from the boat 
and scarcely he could stand.

 o shrieve me  shrieve me  holy man  
the hermit crossed his brow.
 say quick   quoth he   i bid thee say 
what manner of man art thou  

forthwith this frame of mine was wrenched
with a woful agony 
which forced me to begin my tale  
and then it left me free.


since then  at an uncertain hour 
that agony returns   
and till my ghastly tale is told 
this heart within me burns.

i pass  like night  from land to land  
i have strange power of speech  
that moment that his face i see 
i know the man that must hear me   
to him my tale i teach.

what loud uproar bursts from that door 
the wedding guests are there   
but in the garden bower the bride
and bride maids singing are   
and hark the little vesper bell 
which biddeth me to prayer 

o wedding guest  this soul hath been
alone on a wide wide sea   
so lonely  twas  that god himself
scarce seemed there to be.

o sweeter than the marriage feast 
 tis sweeter far to me 
to walk together to the kirk
with a goodly company

to walk together to the kirk 
and all together pray 
while each to his great father bends 
old men  and babes  and loving friends
and youths and maidens gay 

farewell  farewell  but this i tell
to thee  thou wedding guest 
he prayeth well  who loveth well
both man and bird and beast.

he prayeth best  who loveth best
all things both great and small  
for the dear god who loveth us 
he made and loveth all.

the mariner  whose eye is bright 
whose beard with age is hoar 
is gone    and now the wedding guest
turned from the bridegroom s door.

he went like one that hath been stunned 
and is of sense forlorn   
a sadder and a wiser man 
he rose the morrow morn.
