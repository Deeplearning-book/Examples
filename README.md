# Deep Learning: A Practical Introduction - Example Scripts
This repository contains Python scripts corresponding to the examples from the book Deep Learning: A Practical Introduction. The scripts are organized by chapter, with each chapter having its own set of example scripts.
# Structure
The repository is structured as follows:
- Chapter 1:
    - Example 1.2.1 (Perceptron rule).ipynb
    - Example 1.2.2 (MMSE update rule of a perceptron).ipynb
    - Example 1.3.1 (The XOR problem).ipynb
    - Example 1.5.1 (ML vs MMSE in binary classification).ipynb
    - Example 1.5.4 (MLP implementation on toy datasets).ipynb
- Chapter 2:
    - Example 2.x.x
    - ...

(Continue this structure for all 9 chapters)
# Running the Examples
You can run the provided Python scripts in either Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
# Jupyter Notebook
1.	Install Dependencies: To run the scripts in Jupyter Notebook, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. Use the requirements.txt file provided:

  	*pip install -r requirements.txt*
  	
Note: All packages listed in the requirements.txt are CPU-friendly.

2.	Running the Scripts: Open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the directory containing the example scripts. You can then open and run the scripts directly in the notebook.
# Google Colab
1.	Upload the Scripts: Upload the scripts to Google Colab, or clone the repository if you're using Colabâ€™s integration with GitHub.
2.	Install Dependencies: If needed, you can install the dependencies directly within a Colab notebook cell:

  	*!pip install -r requirements.txt*
  	
4.	Run the Scripts: Open the notebook cells and run the scripts as needed.
# GPU Support
The provided requirements.txt includes CPU versions of the deep learning libraries. If you need GPU support, please refer to the following link for instructions on installing GPU-compatible versions of the libraries:
- https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
- https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip
# Notes
- Ensure you have the appropriate versions of Python and Jupyter/Colab for compatibility.
- If you encounter any issues, consult the book or refer to the documentation of the respective libraries.
