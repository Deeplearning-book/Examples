Therefore, for _a_>1 the reciprocal is always returned as 0.\n","7. **np.sqrt(a)** :  Computes the square root of the elements in array _a_\n","8. **np.power(a,b)**: Computes the power of elements of _a_ to elements of _b_\n","\n","On arrays with complex numbers we can use numpy to perform different operations such as follows:\n","\n","1. **np.complex()**: can be used to create a complex number from to inputs\n","2. **np.real()**   : obtains the real part of elements of an array\n","3. **np.imag()**   : Obtains the imaginary part of the elements of an array\n","4. **np.conj()**   : Computes the conjugate of the array elements\n","5. **np.abs()**    : Used to obtain the absolute value of the array elements\n","6. **np.angle()**  : use to get the angle of the complex elements"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":9,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":135,"status":"ok","timestamp":1722037003481,"user":{"displayName":"Meenu Ajith","userId":"05544515161511089785"},"user_tz":240},"id":"Ddi52KmsVeUU","outputId":"50821029-d4bd-481b-ec44-14950172c491"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["[1 2 3 4] [4 5 1 2]\n","after addition\n","[5 7 4 6]\n","using reciprocal on b and b*0.1\n","[0 0 1 0] [ 2.5  2.  10.   5. ]\n","taking the power of a & b\n","[ 1 32  3 16]\n","taking the square root of a\n","[1.         1.41421356 1.73205081 2.        ]\n","complex array:\n","[(1+4j), (2+5j), (3+1j), (4+2j)]\n","real part of the array\n","[1. 2. 3. 4.]\n"]}],"source":["import numpy as np\n","\n","a = np.array([1,2,3,4])   # creating two arrays a and b\n","b = np.array([4,5,1,2])\n","print(a,b)\n","add_ab = np.add(a,b)      # using the numpy addition operation\n","print(\"after addition\")\n","print(add_ab)\n","\n","c = b*0.1                 # creating another array by multipling \"b\" with 0.1\n","\n","rec_b = np.reciprocal(b)  # computing the reciprocal of array b\n","rec_c = np.reciprocal(c)  # computing the reciprocal of new array c\n","print(\"using reciprocal on b and b*0.1\")\n","print(rec_b, rec_c)\n","\n","pow_ab = np.power(a,b)   # computing the power of a to b\n","print(\"taking the power of a & b\")\n","print(pow_ab)\n","\n","sqrt_a = np.sqrt(a)       # computing the square root of a\n","print(\"taking the square root of a\")\n","print(sqrt_a)\n","\n","zip_obj = zip(a, b)      # lets zip the two arrays to get a complex data\n","comp = []                # create an empty list\n","\n","for a,b in zip_obj:      # use for loop to obtain the elements of arrays a & b\n","    c = complex(a,b)  # compute a+jb using np.complex function (#Note that np.complex was changed to complex due to update in Numpy package version.)\n","    comp.append(c)       # append these to the empty list\n","print(\"complex array:\")\n","print(comp)\n","\n","print(\"real part of the array\")\n","print(np.real(comp))     # getting real part of the complex array\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"OOe5tqudVeUV"},"source":["## **Mathematical functions:**\n","\n","1. __Trigonometric functions__:\n","\n","   a) _np.sin_, _np.cos_, _np.tan_ are used for computing element wise trigonometric operation.<br>\n","   b) _np.arcsin_, _np.arccos__np.arctan_ are used for performing inverse trigonometric operations.<br>\n","   c) _np.degrees_, _np.radians_, _np.deg2rad_, _np.rad2deg_ are used for converting the angles from radians to degrees and vice versa.\n","   \n","   \n","2. __Hyperbolic functions__:\n","\n","   a) _np.sinh_, _np.cosh_, _np.tanh_ are used for computing element wise hyerbolic operation.<br>\n","   b) _np.arcsinh_, _np.arccosh__np.arctanh_ are used for performing inverse hyperbolic operations.<br>\n","   \n","3. __Rounding functions__:\n","\n","   a) _np.around_ : even rounding.
